# Drag Race NY Queens Data
Using Python to analyze Drag Race NY contestant data then make an infographic. My first test project while trying to learn *pandas*. Data is originally from [Rupaul-Predict-A-Looza](https://shiraamitchell.github.io/rpdr) and was updated to season 12 by me using a Wikipedia request.
### Feel free to use the updated data - "all_contestants.csv" and "dragrank_to12.csv"
